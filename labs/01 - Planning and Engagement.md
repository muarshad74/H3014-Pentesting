### 1. Organising your notes

A huge factor in becoming a successful Penetration tester will be your ability to keep accurate, usable, and up-to-date notes. You will need to learn how to keep your notes and tools updated, and how to install and research new tools. Having an organised structured set of notes will allow you record new tips and tricks, your notes, and thoughts, and overall help you improve and remember the huge amount of information you'll be exposed too in the early years as you learn the skills of a Penetration Tester.

During the Penetration test itself you'll have a lot of varied information that you'll need to record for inclusion in your final report, so having some structured way to record everything (screenshots, tool output, dumps, logs, address etc.) will be essential. Unfortunately, there isn't any standard or simple one size fits all solution, and every pentester will use their own variation and tools to record their data. So it's worth experimenting and playing around with various tools to see which you prefer yourself for recording all your notes, and results.

Common tools used include: Cherry tree, evernote, sublime Text, VS Code, Noepad++, notion, Gitbook, Onenote, Outline, Obsidian, Cryptpad etc.


### 2. Getting started with Obsidian
The tool I'm going to suggest you use (at least to get started with until you choose your own favourite) is Obsidian (https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian works on all platforms and is a hugely powerful and extensible knowledge base that works on top of your local folder of plain text files. It has hundreds of community plugins and addons that gives you massive scope in how you record your data.

> :star: ACTION: Install and setup Obsidian on your own system

The obsidian Forums and Discord chat are very active and helpful, so I suggest you explore them and the plugins sections looking for cool addons for your own notes.

> ⭐ ACTION: Explore the Obsidian Plugins for useful plugins for yourself.

One additional (optional) step you might want to try set up is using github to backup/sync your obsidian notes. there are plenty of instructions and guides on the Obsidian websites and chats to help you get it setup, if you wish.


### 3. Create summary notes for Chapter 1 - Planning & Engagement.

The first chapter in the textbook deals with the topic of 'Planning and Engagement' and includes a huge amount of new terminology that you'll need to know and understand for the both the in-class exam but also if you ever plan to take the Pentest+ (or similar exams). It is also terminology you'll be expected to know in any real-world work environment as a pentester.

There isn't anything overly complicated but there is a lot of new terminology so you need to study and learn them. We are going to try creating a set of summary notes for ourselves for everything in Chapter 1. This will allow us to get some practise using Obsidian, create a set of useful notes for our own study. 

> 💡As a bonus: any notes you create in your Obsidian vault, can be used during the final practical exam. These will be the only notes allowed in the exam. 

> ⭐ ACTION: Create a set of summary notes for Planning and Engagement chapter from the course book. You are free to split into groups or 2 or 3 and divide the workload ie. Each person can do half the chapter sections and then you can both merge the notes to create a full set. 


### 4. Complete the TryHackMe Labs.
